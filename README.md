# Scraping rig count data from Baker Hughes
In the oil and gas industry, rig activity is a good indication of the performance of a country in the industry. On a monthly basis, Baker Hughes tracks and reports the rig count and as an energy analyst, it is important to stay up to date with this data. Using the Scrapy library, I have written a script that accesses the Baker Hughes database through its website and downloads the data so as to automate the update process.

This data will eventually be visualized on PowerBI and as the script is updated, the dashboard is updated as well. Stakeholders can now have real time information on the general performance of the oil and gas industry.
